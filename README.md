# Omashu

> Coordinate book club sessions and share annotations with your friends!

## What is Omashu?

Omashu is a self-hosted book club tool with the hope of making book club sessions with your friends a lot more fun by
removing the hassle of coordinating across time zones and having separate copies of the same book with different
annotations.

## Origins of Omashu

Omashu is based off of the city of Omashu in Avatar: The Last Airbender where it had the Earth Kingdom's Royal Library.
